Important note: 
Unfortunately, the IDE in this omnetpp version has a bug that is does not properly add include directories of referenced projects
to the include path. For the components relevant in the roVer project, this leads to the problem that the INET headers are not
found when trying to build the simuLTE project.

Workaround: Manually add the INET/src/inet directory to the include path by 
right-click on simuLTE project, expand C/C++ General tab, slect "Paths and Symbols",
click "Add" to add new include path
