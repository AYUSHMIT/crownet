# Eclipse IDE for OMNeT++

This directory contains the base IDE that is required in order to run OMNeT++. It is not included in the OMNeT++ repository but delivered
as part of the OMNeT++ source tar archive on the website. 

If you compile OMNeT++ based on the sources in the roVer gitlab repository, the files in the ide.tar.gz archive
need to be extracted to ./ide in the omnetpp directory. 

## Version
Version has been extracted from the OMNeT++ Version 5.4.1
