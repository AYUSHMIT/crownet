# Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)

This repository contains scripts that allow users to conduct paramater studies for certain crownet simulations (../../crownet/crownet/simulations/).
Python>=3.8 is required.

## Setup the virtual environment
We strongly recommend to use a virtual environment
```
python3.8 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the simulations
Change to the simulation directory and run the script.
