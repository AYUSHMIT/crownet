# roVer Application Layer
This document describes the assumptions and model for the roVer applications.

## Motivation and Example Applications
The roVer approach provides robust information dissemination for a wide range
of applications for mobile persons (e.g. pedestrians or public transport
users).

**Categories**
1. Safety (e.g. information on the local density of persons in order to avoid
   overcrowded areas, entrances, shopping stores - in particular in situations
   like Corona, emergency alerts, cooperative situation awareness)
2. Mobility (e.g. proactive traffic information system, monitoring usage of
   public transportation systems)
3. Infotainment (e.g. tourist information, temperature/weather map, local
   advertisements)

Within roVer, the focus is on the first two categories.


## Assumptions
* Dissemination of location-dependent information for a mobile person
  (pedestrian, public transport, idividual transport)
* Information can be associated with a time-stamp. More recent information
  (larger value of associated time-stamp) is a more accurate representation of
  the current situation.
* Address of source and destination of information (e.g. IP- or MAC-addresses)
  are not known beforehand.
* The relevance (utility) of information decreases with increasing geographic
  distance to the location it refers to.
  * Refined: The relevance of detailed information decreases with increasing
    geographical distance. Information on a coarse scale may be still useful.
    For example in my direct to medium vicinity a more granular grid is needed
    but with increasing distance the cells can be bigger.

## General Model

* geographic area subdevided into (rectangular) cells of length *a*
* each cell *i* has an associated value *v_i* and time-stamp *t_i*
* value *v_i* of a cell changes within random time-intervals (random variable
  with a pdf that is application specific)
* Shannon entropy (calculated based on number of cells and pdfs for *v_i* and
  *t_i*) can be used to characterize the amount of information that is
  generated by the application and should be disseminated.


## Extended Model
* aggregation of multiple cells: Values of multiple cells can be aggregated,
  e.g. for users at a larger distance. This reduces the precision of the
  location (due to the increased area of the aggregated cell) but also the data

## Implemented Example Applications

Within roVer, the following applications are implemented in order to
investigate the performance in various mobility and network situations:
1. **Local density map** in order to avoid overcrowded areas
