# vadere Scenario Files
This folder contains the vadere scenario files - they can be edited within the vadere-gui.

Note: The additional *_env.xml files are used for visualizing the scenario within OMNeT++. 
They can be exported in vadere in the "Post-Visualization" step. Simply select the camera 
symbol and choose "INET Env" as export format.
